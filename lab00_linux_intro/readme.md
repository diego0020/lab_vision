# Introduction to Linux

## Preparation

1. Boot from a live cd, we will be using the [Ubuntu gnome](http://ubuntugnome.org/) distribution.

2. Configure keyboard and software repository
   From the *Activities* menu (top left corner, or *start* key):
      -  Go to settings, keyboard and add the layout for latin america
      -  Go to software and updates, and select the server for Colombia

## Introduction to Linux

1. The graphical interface

   Linux can be run using a graphical interface. There are several of these available for every taste.
   (http://www.howtogeek.com/163154/linux-users-have-a-choice-8-linux-desktop-environments/).
   Most activities can be accomplished from the interface, but the terminal is where the real power lies.

2. Linux Distributions

   Linux is free software, and as such it is possible for people to do all kinds of things with it.
   The main component in linux is the kernel, which is the part of the operating system that interfaces 
   with the hardware and manages resources. Applications run on top of it on user space. 
   Distributions pack together the kernel with several 
   applications in order to provide a complete system. There are hundreds of linux distributions available. In
   this lab we will be using Ubuntu because it is one of the largest, more supported, and user friendly distributions.

2. The file system through the terminal   
   Some basic commands to navigate through the file system

   -  ls: List contents of current directory
   -  pwd: Give location of current directory
   -  cd: Change Directory
   -  cat: Print contents of a file (and concatenate files)
   -  mv: Move a file
   -  cp: Copy a file
   -  rm: Remove a file
   -  touch: Create a file, or update its timestamp
   -  echo: Print something to standard output
   -  nano: Edit files
   -  find: Find files and perform actions on it
   -  which: Find the location of a binary

   Some special directories are:
      - ``.`` (dot) : The current directory
      -  ``..`` (two dots) : The parent of the current directory
      -  ``/`` (slash): The root of the file system
      -  ``~`` (tilde) :  Home directory
      
   Take some time to explore the file system
   
   To find more information about a command call it with the ``--help`` flag, call ``man <command>``, like
   for example ``man find`` or search in google.

2. Find the ```passwd```file
   >  ``find / -name passwd 2 > /dev/null``

   The ``2>`` operator redirects the error output to ``/dev/null``. This is a special file that acts as a sink,
   anything that is send to it will dissappear. Other important redirection operations are
      -  `` > `` : Redirect standard output to a file
      -  `` | `` : Redirect standard output to standar input of another program
      -  `` 2> ``: Redirect error output to a file
      -  `` < `` : Send contents of a file to standard input
      -  `` 2>&1``: Send error output to the sampe place as standard output

3. To have a nicer display of the *passwd* we can use the following command. It sends the content of the 
   file to the ``tr`` command, which translates columns to tabs.

   ```bash
   cat /etc/passwd | tr ':' '\t'
   ```
   
4. Owner and permissions   
   Use ``ls -l`` to see a detailed list of files, this includes permissions and ownership
   Permissions are displayed as 9 letters, for example the following line means that the directory (we know it is a directory becasue of the first *d*) *images*
   belongs to user *vision* and group *vision*. Its owner can read write and enter it, users in the group can only read and enter the directory, while other users can't do anything. For files the x means execute. 
   ```bash
   drwxr-x--- 2 vision vision 4096 ene 25 18:45 images
   ```
   See http://linuxcommand.org/lts0070.php for more information.
   
   -  ``chmod`` change access permissions of a file (you must have write access)
   -  ``chown`` change the owner of a file

## Exercise: Image database

1. The following command lets us connect to another machine and use its terminal,
   the second command lets us copy files between systems.

   ```bash
   
   #connect
   ssh vision@SERVER
   
   #copy 
   scp vision@SERVER:/datos1/vision/sipi_images/<file> .
   ```
   
2.  Decompress the images (use ``tar``, check the man)
3.  Use  ``imagemagick`` to find all *grayscale* images
    Notice that we first need to install the *imagemagick* package by typing

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install imagemagick
    ```
    
    Sudo is a special command that lets us perform the next command as if we were system administrators
    (super users). In general it is not recommended to work as a super user, it should only be used 
    when it is necessary. This provides additional protectection for the system.
    
    ```bash
    find . -name "*.tiff" -exec identify {} \; | grep -i gray | wc -l
    ```
    
4.  Create a script to copy all *color* images to a different folder
    Lines that start with # are comments
       
      ```bash
      #!/bin/bash
      
      # go to Home directory
      cd ~
      # remove the folder created by a previous run from the script
      rm -r color_images 2>/dev/null
      # create otuput directory
      mkdir color_images
      # find all files whose name end in .tif
      images=$(find sipi_images -name *.tiff)
      
      #iterate over them
      for im in ${images[*]}
      do
         # check if the output from identify contains the word "gray"
         identify $im | grep -q -i gray
         
         # $? gives the exit code of the last command, in this case grep, it will be zero if a coincidense was found
         if [ $? -eq 0 ]
         then
            echo $im is gray
         else
            echo $im is color
            cp $im color_images
         fi
      done
      
      ```
      -  save it for example as ``find_color_images.sh``
      -  make executable ``chmod u+x`` (This means add Execute permision for the user)
      -  run ``./find_duplicates.sh`` (The dot is necessary to run a program in the current directory)
      
5.  Find all images with size larger than 500k
6.  how many are there? (use ``wc`` and ``find``)
   
7. Convert all images to *jpg* (tip: use ``mogrify``)
