This is a picture I took of an alleyway in Morocco in December of 2012. I can’t exactly remember the city, but I think it’s Fez. Fez is famous for it’s walled medina, which resembles a labyrinth since it’s so easy to get lost: it’s full of shoulder-width alleyways and dead ends, twists and turns and it’s dangerous to go there without knowing your way around. In fact, our guide told us she got lost in the medina for 2 days when she was kid.
