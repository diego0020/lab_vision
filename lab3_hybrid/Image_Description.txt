Boot Image

The Boot Image was taken from myself in the very same classroom in which we take the course
"Computer Vision", the idea of taking a picture of my very own boot was due to the fact that I 
tried before implementing the code with my own face and a coin, yet I had no good results.
This boot has been with me for about a year now, and all I can say about it, is that it is a very
good piece of leatherwork and also it is a reliable foot wear.

Bottle Image

As soon as I took the picture of my boot, I thought about it's shape, I needed to have an item
with about the same proportions of said piece, and so as I was going home I realised how much
water I needed to drink due to the flue that I currently have, and so as I took up my bottle and
drank a little bit of water I realised that the bottle had about the same size and shape of my 
boot, and so as I arrived home, I took my bottle out and had a picture of it. 
This bottle is a sturdy one even if it is made of plastic, it has been with me for one and a half
years.
