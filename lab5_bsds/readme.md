# Berkeley Segmentation Data Set and Benchmarks 500 (BSDS500)

## Source

This lab uses resources from the 
[Berkley Computer Vision Group](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/resources.html),
please look at their website.

## Download data

The data for this lab can be downloaded from the course server using the following protocols

- ssh or rsync : ``vision@157.253.63.7:/datos1/vision/images/BSR_full.tgz``
- http: http://157.253.63.7/BSR_full.tgz

The original sources can be found in the Berkley group page.

**Note**: Don't add any of these files to your repository, they are too big.

## Data description

The folder will contain the following direcotries

- bench: Code for running benchmarks and comparing algorithms
- BSD500: 
  -   Data: Images and manual segmentations (ground truth)
  -   ucm2: Precalculated results of the *Ultrametric Contour Map* segmentation algorithm,
-   Documentation: Paper describing the UCM algorithm
-   Grouping: The UCM algorithm implementation

## Ground truth data

The ground truth data is saved as matlab data, it contains manual segmentation from different people. For example,
to look at the ground truth for image ``train/22090`` we can use the following code

```matlab
load('BSDS500/data/groundTruth/train/22090.mat')
% Load segmentation from first human
segm=groundTruth{1}.Segmentation;
image(segm)
colormap colorcube

% create a new figure
figure
% Boundaries from first human
bound=groundTruth{1}.Boundaries;
image(bound)
colormap flag
```

Look at the ground truth data for the different human participants, and different images.

## Benchmark

**Warning:** The mex files required are not available for windows

The file ``bench/test_benchs.m`` contains several examples of how to use the benchmark functions for different types of *result* images. Look at it and run the examples.

Look at the file that defines the function ``boundaryBench`` and read the description of its inputs.

# Homework

## Calibrate your segmentation mehthod

Adjust the function you designed in the past lab so that it works on the BSDS, and find the best combinations of parameters.

```matlab
function my_segmentation = segment_by_clustering( rgb_image, feature_space, clustering method, number of clusters)
```

Use only the ``train`` and ``eval`` datasets to calibrate your function. See http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/resources.html#bsds500 for more information.

## Test your function

Run a **Boundary** benchmark on two cases of your function, and compare it to the state of the art. Use the ``test`` data set of the BSDS500. The final plot should contain at least three lines (two instances of your function and the UCM algorithm). You can also use the plot found [in this repository](Figure02.fig) as a base. Look at the code of the ``plot_eval`` function for more information on how to create these plots.

See http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/resources.html#bench for an example otuput.

Use different thresholds values to generate a curve.

A summary of the steps required is:

  - Apply your function to each of the images in the *test* dataset
  - For each image, create a *.mat* file that contains a cell array, which contains severa matrices representing the output of the function for different values of the parameter. Look at the *bench/data/segs* folder for examples.
  - Run the ``boundaryBench`` function specifying the folder with the *.mat* files as ``pbDir``. See the third example in the *test_benchs* file.
  - Generate the plot using the code from the ``test_eval`` function.

## Report

Write a report describing your chosen segmentation methods, the testing methodology, the results from the tests, and a discussion about the results and potential improvements to the function. Use the CVPR LaTeX template. Upload to your repository the report (tex and pdf) and the code for your segmentation function. A rubric of how this report will be graded can be found [here](rubric.md).  You may work in pairs.


**Due:** March 17, 2016; 8:00 a.m.

## Running the benchmark remotely

The full benchmark on the 200 test images can take a several hours. If you prefer, you may run it on the course server. 

However, all of you would be using the same account so please take into account the following

- Be careful not to mess with other people's data or processes
- Create a new directory and work only there, don't go into other people's directories

In order to be able to disconnect from the server and let it keep working you can use [sceen](http://linux.die.net/man/1/screen).
Connect using ``ssh`` and afterwards type

```bash
screen -S <session_name>
```

Use your name as session name, so that you don't get confused with other people working at the same time. If you disconnect from the session, you can return to it by typing

```bash
screen -r <session_name>
```
