The three convolutional layers are used to extract specific patterns inside the input images. This is made by calculting image responses to different filters created previously. 
Additionally, the pooling layers were implemented in order obtain relevant information in each of the images. This information results relevant because it represents interest points inside the image regardless its scale. This layers makes a non-linesr subsampling which consists in partitioning the input image into a group pf non-overlapping patches and then extracting de maximum value for each created subregion. This is made in order to reduce the computaion os the upper layers and for to get invariance translation.
The idea of using both layers in a mixed way (one after the other) is to complimment both information in order to have a better representation of the image That could be useful to classify it.
